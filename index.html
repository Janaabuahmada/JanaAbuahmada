    <h1>&#128187; Online Collection's Text Analysis</h1>
   <p>During my second week at my Qatar Museums internship, I was assigned the task of counting and identifying unique words in an Excel sheet containing all the text from 
     the museum's online collection website. As shown in the picture bellow, the highlighted words are repeatedin different locations in both languages Arabic and English.</p>

</div>
  I    used  Visual  Studio  to  streamline  the  process. I  tockenized each word,  removed  capitalization, and  filtered  out  numbers,  enabling  me
  to  identify  and  remove  duplicates  and  create  a  clean  list  of  unique  terms. Through  this  analysis,  I  discovered  that  almost 90%  of  the  words  were 
  recurrent,  suggesting  that  with  techniques  like  named  entity  recognition  (NER),  it  would  be  much  easier  for  the  translation  team  to  focus on  unique
  or  context-specific  terms.    Later,  I joined  a  meeting  with the digital  experience  team  to  present  my  findings,  where  I  explained  the  technical  aspects
  of  my  process  and  demonstrated  how  this  analysis  could  enhance  the  museum’s  online  content.    This  experience  gave  me  valuable  feedback  and  further 
  insight  into  how digital  transformation  can  improve  user  engagement  with  museum  collections.  I  am  now  curious  to  learn  how  I  can  use  NER  for  both 
  English  and  Arabic.</p>

    <h1>&#128203; Text Mining Journey</h1>
   <p>This week at my internship with Qatar Museums has been an exciting dive into the world of text mining. My supervisor, Christophe, handed me a book called Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach, and I've been really into it ever since. Text mining is incredibly important for our digital transformation team because it helps us make sense of large volumes of unstructured text data by extracting meaningful patterns and insights. The process involves several key steps:
<ul>
 <li> Collecting text data</li>
 <li>	Cleaning and preprocessing it</li>
 <li>	Transforming it into a structured format</li>
 <li>	Applying analytical techniques to draw conclusions</li>
</ul>
<p>By learning these skills, I'm not only gaining valuable knowledge but also tools that can significantly enhance our team's ability to:
<ul>
 <li> Understand visitor feedback</li>
 <li>	Improve overall experience</li>
 <li>	Drive strategic decisions</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Practical Challenges </b>

I learned some techniques to clean and prepare the text data using R. However, I faced some challenges as my laptop lagged when running certain functions, requiring me to restart R Studio every time to install each package. I couldn't use the desktop because I can't download R on it.</p>

<p><b>Learning Outcomes</b>

<ul>
<li>	Connecting what I'm learning with my university studies</li>
<li>	Finding immense satisfaction in deepening my understanding of text mining techniques</li>
<li>	Trying out an online tutorial about text mining spam and ham emails</li>
<li>	This was my first experience learning about machine learning methods</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>How it might contibute to the team's work</b>
<ul>
<li>	Sentiment Analysis for the vistors experience.</li>
<li>	Topic modeling which can be applied for content recommendation, social media analysis and customer feedback analysis</li>
<li>	Extracting useful information from different sorces</li>
</ul></p>

<h1>&#128253;A Visit To Mathaf:A Wider Lens, A New Gérôme</h1>
<p>I joined the digital experience team on a visit to Mathaf Museum's Gérôme exhibition, which displayed his paintings and drawings in a chronological order, covering his biography, artistic style, and political impact. We tested the audio guide as guests, which provided useful context for each piece and continued working when using other apps. However, weak Wi-Fi in the gallery affected its performance. The visit offered important insights for our digital engagement projects.

<h1 align="left" id="W5">&#128250;Ed Rodley Presentation </h1>
<p>It was nice to meet Ed Rodley and attend his presentation on museum engagement. He explained the four avenues of engaging visitors: sensory immersion, emotional evocation, narrative transportation, and gameful participation. I learned how museum design considers helping people connect with their emotions while being careful not to manipulate them into feeling a certain way. This gave me a new understanding of the thoughtfulness behind creating visitor experiences.</p>

<h1 align="left" id="W6">&#128694;Visitors Analysis </h1>
<p> Exploring Bristol’s visitor data as time series data aimed to:
<ul>
<li>Analyze daily trends, including seasonal changes and weekday vs. weekend patterns.	</li>
<li>Understand the impact of events and holidays on visitor numbers.	</li>
<li>Predict future visitor numbers to support businesses and tourism efforts.	</li>
</ul>
Challenges faced:
<ul>
<li>The data showed no clear trends or seasonality, requiring me to explore different machine learning models.</li>
<li>I was unable to run machine learning functions in R on my laptop due to resource limitations.</li>
<li>Preparing and cleaning the data took longer than expected.</li> 
</ul></p>

  <h1>&#128188;ICOM</h1>
<p>Attending the ICOM (International Council of Museums) conference at Qatar's Museum of Art was a valuable experience, offering the chance to 
  engage with global museum professionals and learn about the latest trends and innovations. I attended sessions on digital transformation and
  explored new museum practices, which were insightful. However, I was disappointed by some of the presentations, as their titles were misleading 
  and led me to expect more in-depth discussions. Instead, the content often didn’t align with the expectations set by the titles, which was a letdown.
  Despite this, I still gained valuable knowledge and made meaningful connections with experts in the field.</p>

<h1>&#128376;Web Scraping</h1>
<p> In my last week I learned more about web scraping using R, which I believe will be a game-changer for Sadia's work on translation memory for the museum's online collection. 
  Web scraping allows us to automate the collection of large amounts of data from various online sources, eliminating the need for manual extraction. Since translation memory
  relies on accurate and consistent data inputs, this method ensures that we can gather the necessary text efficiently and systematically. Additionally, it saves time, 
  reduces errors, and frees up resources to focus on refining the translation process, making the overall workflow much more productive. </p>
